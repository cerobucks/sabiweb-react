        <h1>Hi, I'm Sergio. Nice to meet you.</h1>
         <p>My journey started 3 year ago when a friend spoke to me about <br/>
             software and programming languages. Since then I can't stop learning. <br/>
             I've done work with software agencies and I've tried to create <br/>
             my own startup. I'm just a curios guy that loves to innovate and <br/>
             use cool tech to create software.</p>
