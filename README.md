In this project I integrated to react my portfolio / blog web design that is hosted here: [https://github.com/sabiwebs/first_web_design]

Future updates:
1. Add blog components.
2. Add portfolio view components.
3. Add redux to the project.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
